## Project description
The Eclipse OMR project consists of a highly integrated set of open source C
and C++ components that can be used to build robust language runtimes that will
support many different hardware and operating system platforms. These components
include but are not limited to: memory management, threading, platform port
(abstraction) library, diagnostic file support, monitoring support,
garbage collection, and native Just In Time compilation. The long term goal for 
the Eclipse OMR project is to foster an open ecosystem of language runtime
developers to collaborate and collectively innovate with hardware platform
designers, operating system developers, as well as tool and framework developers
and to provide a robust runtime technology platform so that language
implementers can much more quickly and easily create more fully featured
languages to enrich the options available to programmers.
